using Jekyll and trying to create a blog post layout (with excerpt)

dang. Does Minima not support /_layouts/blog-post.html (?)<br>

<h3>other posts</h3>
<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
  <l1>
    <h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
    {{ post.excerpt }}
  </l1>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

welp, spent a long time trying to create a different layout style, and only managed to add the author after the date, and I'm not even sure if that was intentional. Was also tryin to get a list of posts (like I was able to in Thirteen) but used a different method and cannot seem to get it to work.
