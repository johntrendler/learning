Last week I messed up this repository with some code trying to override the stylesheet or something. 
I don't really remember what I was trying to do - something with CSS and templates. Since it didn't work & posts wouldn't publish, I got frustrated and walked away.
Now it's Saturday and I'm having coffee at a cafe, writing code.
