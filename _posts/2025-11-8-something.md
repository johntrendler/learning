Something from nothing HTML.
GeoCities early 2000's, currently
the archeological ruins of a previous
civilization, pre blockchain.
Excavating literal bits, unearthing
long forgotten code. Some of the
previous infrastucture continues to
lumber forward into the future,
crackling and sputtering. The old
gods with new followers ~ running
renegade systems and supporting 
microcosms in forgotten basements.
No longer competing for market
saturation or subscribers. A thin
veil of dust
